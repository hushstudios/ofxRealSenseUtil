# ofxRealSenseUtil
Wrapper and Utilities for RealSense SDK

## Dependency
* IntelRealSense / [librealsense](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense)
  * Using the installer (Intel.RealSense.SDK.exe) is recommended
## Feature
* Polygon (triangulated geometry) creation in a separated thread
* Linkage to the path of SDK location in Build Solution (Windows only)

## TODO
* Mac compatibility (But [this addon](https://github.com/hiroMTB/ofxRealsense2) seems very nice for mac)
